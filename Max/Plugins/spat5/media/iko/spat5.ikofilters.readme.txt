spat5.ikofilters

=====================================================================
The filters in the iko3/ directory correspond to decoding filters provided by Sonible.
Originally under the names:
Filters/iko3/IKO3_11-Oct-2018_LOW_TASTE_EQ/IKOFilter_SH_In1.wav
Filters/iko3/IKO3_11-Oct-2018_LOW_TASTE_EQ/IKOFilter_SH_In2.wav
...
Filters/iko3/IKO3_11-Oct-2018_LOW_TASTE_EQ/IKOFilter_SH_In16.wav

These files are with ACN SN3D convention, and for : 
IKO3 model (with 6" full range speakers ??)
IKO decoder plus crosstalk cancellation and limited radial filters 
Measurement / FilterDesign: 2021-02-26_LDVMessungIKO001007 / 10-Mar-2021 

The original files provided by Sonible are 4096-tap FIR at 44100 Hz.
For spat5.ikofilters, the original files have been resampled to 48 kHz,
and truncated to 2048 and 1024-tap for efficiency.
(truncated versions also include a short 16-sample fade-out)
The 4096 and 2048 versions are nearby identical (in terms of magnitude and group delay responses).
The 1024 version exhibit minor differences (inaudible?) in the low frequency region.

for short description of the IKO1, IKO2 and IKO3 specifications.
IKO3 corresponds to the version manufactured by Sonible.
